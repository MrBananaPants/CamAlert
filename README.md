# CamAlert
A Python 3 app that sends a notification if there's a new analog camera available on 2dehands (the Ebay of Belgium).
The app runs in the background on macOS and sends a system notification if it sees a new deal is available.
Beautiful Soup is used as HTML parser and [rumps](https://github.com/jaredks/rumps) is used to make the status bar app.

# Requirements to build
You need `py2app` to compile the app yourself.

Use `pip install -U py2app` to install it.

From the root of the project folder, run `python setup.py py2app -A` in the terminal to compile the app in Alias mode. The app is ready to open and test in the `dist` folder.

If everything works fine, and you want to create a stand-alone version, you have to remove the build and dist folder (`rm -rf build dist`). Then run `python setup.py py2app` to build the app. The stand-alone build is available in the `dist` folder.
